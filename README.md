# MyWork â€“ Hamad Aljenibi's Project Collection

Welcome to **MyWork**, a personal collection of programming files and projects Iâ€™ve created over the past few years as a student and developer.

This repository includes a variety of code samples and experiments that reflect my learning journey and technical growth.

## ðŸ”§ What's Inside

- **Colab Notebooks**: Python scripts and AI-related experiments written using Google Colab.
- **Random Files**: A mix of older and recent code files in **Python**, **Java**, and **Swift**, collected from school tasks, side projects, and experiments.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Iâ€™ve Worked With
- **Python** â€“ For general programming, automation, and AI tasks.
- **Java** â€“ Used in academic assignments and object-oriented projects.
- **Swift** â€“ Used for iOS app development and exploring Appleâ€™s ecosystem.
- *(Some files may be incomplete or unformatted due to recovery from older devices.)*

## ðŸ’¡ About Me
I'm **Hamad Aljenibi**, a senior student at **Applied Technology Schools** in the UAE.  
Iâ€™m passionate about solving real-world problems using technology.

One of my major projects is **TransLy** â€” a voice translation platform that connects people to human translators in real time. I also developed an AI chatbot to support the service.

## ðŸ“Œ Note
This repo is not a single project but a showcase of my progress, creativity, and exploration across different programming languages.
