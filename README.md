# 🧠 MyWork – Personal Programming Portfolio by Hamad Aljenibi

Welcome to **MyWork**, a personal collection of programming files and projects I’ve created over the past few years as a student and developer.

This repository includes a variety of code samples and experiments that reflect my learning journey and technical growth.

## 🔧 What's Inside

- **Colab Notebooks**: Python scripts and AI-related experiments written using Google Colab.
- **Random Files**: A mix of older and recent code files in **Python**, **Java**, and **Swift**, collected from school tasks, side projects, and experiments.

## 🌐 Web Development Experience
I’ve also explored **web development**, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
You can view one of my web projects, **Isma**, here:

## 🧠 Technologies I’ve Worked With
- **Python** – For general programming, automation, and AI tasks.
- **Java** – Used in academic assignments and object-oriented projects.
- **Swift** – For iOS app development and exploring Apple’s ecosystem.
- **Web Development** – HTML/CSS/JavaScript (see the Isma project link above)

## 💡 About Me
I'm **Hamad Aljenibi**, a senior student at **Applied Technology Schools** in the UAE.  
I’m passionate about solving real-world problems using technology, especially in areas like communication and accessibility.

One of my major projects is **TransLy** — a voice translation platform that connects people to human translators in real time. I also developed an AI chatbot to support the service.

## 📌 Note
This repo is not a single project but a showcase of my progress, creativity, and exploration across different programming languages.
